17/11/2022: Until now I have mostly spent time on the set exercises from makers academy. I would like to write down my own goals and other types of work to work through as well. Today I started watching the Harvard CS50 series on youtube. I have been intending to do this for a while and just getting round to it now!

22/11/2022: Today I tidied up my files from the previous two weeks and sorted out some things on github. I really felt like I understood git and github a whole lot more. I knew what I needed to do and I knew what the error messages were. I removed remotes and added new ones. Previously I would have panicked and deleted remote repos.
